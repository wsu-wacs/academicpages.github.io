        IEEE Intl. Conference on Machine Learning and Applications</a> 2017. 
        This work presents a generative process for producing synthetic sequences
        of web robot traffic. A stochastic process moderates temporal 
        properties while a Bayesian model assigns behavioral attributes. The 
        synthetic traffic impacts the performance of web server caches in similar
        ways as real robot traffic. Well done Kyle! </p>
